# Assignment Week 5

The assignment of this week is aimed at bringing out the diverse applications of python. Python is an open source scripting 
language and can be used to automate anything! This week allows you to explore the language beyond its innate simplicity and versatility.
What makes Python stand out are its vast assortments of libraries and packages that can cater to a wide range of development as well as Data Science requirements. 
Python can cater to a lot of real world applcations and most of these are very easy to implement in just a few lines of code.

Since this assignment is for your exploration, we have given open ended tasks with minimum requirements to be fulfilled. You are allowed to ideate and innovate as much as 
possible. Of course, it would require a lot of googling too as you are writing new kinds of programs, so you may encounter unexpected errors. Don't give up at any stage, 
it may be an iterative process but after doing these tasks you will become more confident as a programmer in trying new stuff.


The assignment has 4 categories of tasks with 3 requiring submission and one for exploration and learning. Each task has multiple options for you to choose from and minimum one 
needs to be done. Some relevant links are included for assistance but blind copying of code is strongly discouraged. You must show your ingenuity too!

## Task 1
Do at least one (all recommended) of the following - 
1. Develop an OCR which recognizes text from an image (black and white) and outputs the text to a file. Submission should include - a python file, an image the program was tested on, a txt file 
storing the output coressponding to the image.

2. Develop a pdf to text converter which recognizes text from a pdf (black and white) and outputs the text to a file. Submission should include - a python file, 
a pdf the program was tested on, a txt file storing the output coressponding to the pdf.
