# Web Dev (LS 2020) Week 3: BOOTSTRAP + JAVASCRIPT

We are back with Week 3 of our course on Web Development.
This week we will go through adding a bit of responsiveness to webpages utilizing the functions and features of JavaScript.
We also have an optional tutorial for Bootstrap, which will help you design the layout and style of webpages in an effective and efficient manner.

We hope that you have followed all the articles for [Git](https://github.com/wncc/learners-space/blob/master/Web%20Development/Week%201/Git.md) ,[HTML](https://github.com/wncc/learners-space/blob/master/Web%20Development/Week%201/HTML.md) and [CSS](https://github.com/wncc/learners-space/blob/master/Web%20Development/Week%202/CSS.md), as a basic knowledge of those is a prerequisite for this week's content.

Note: Bootstrap is Optional and you may skip, if you are stuggling with time for other courses. We do recommend that you do it, as it will be helpful further on.

So let's get started!

## What is Bootstrap? 
Bootstrap is a powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development. It includes HTML and CSS based design templates for creating common user interface components like forms, buttons, navigations, dropdowns, alerts, modals, tabs, accordions, carousels, tooltips, and so on.
Bootstrap gives you ability to create flexible and responsive web layouts with much less efforts.

Here is a tutorial which guides you on how to setup and integrate Bootstrap to your HTML Page: [Setting Up Bootstrap](https://websitesetup.org/bootstrap-tutorial-for-beginners/)

## Getting Started with JavaScript

### What is JavaScript?
Javascript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

Here are series of articles which will fully lead you to JS that you need to know for Web Dev purposes

## Assignment
No assignment!! Yes indeed, no assignment this week. We took into account that some of you are busy with other courses, so we have decided to have no assignment for the week. Next week we'll have a major assignment, so don't take this week's topics lightly!
If you have no other commitments, we advise you to utilize this time for completing any content that you have left in previous week. Also, if you have completed this week well in advance and left bootstrap, then do give a try learning bootstrap as it is quite important and is used in almost all places in Web Development nowadays.

### Optional Assignment
These are some optional assignments that you can glance through to see the variety of things that JS can do and try some of them on your own if you like!!

 - [Counter Project](https://romeojeremiah.github.io/Counter-Project/)
 - [Calculator](https://romeojeremiah.github.io/Calculator-JavaScript-Project/)
 - [Animated Navigation Toggle](https://codepen.io/AJamesL/pen/MXmvZp?page=5)
