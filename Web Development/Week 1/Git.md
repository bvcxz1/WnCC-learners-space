# Web Dev (LS 2020) Week 1: Git/GitHub

Welcome to Week 1 of Web Development, Learners' Space.

The agenda for this week is to learn Git, hosting pages with GitHub/BigHome and start with learning HTML.

So, without wasting any more time, let's get started with our tutorial on Git.


## Introduction

Git is a Version Control System which helps you collaborate and work with other programmers on projects easily. So now the question is what is a Version Control System? Version Control is a system that records all the changes you do to your files and logs them. This enables you to go back to them and start working on your files from that point. It's basically like time travel. If while working on your files you realise that you have done something majorly wrong but can't sit and undo every change. The best option for you is to ask your version control system to simply go back to the instance from where you want to start again.

As you can see, having a version control system has a lot of benefits. It helps to keep track of previous versions of your code. On the other hand, GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.




## Getting Started

The first step is installing git on your system.
Follow this [link](https://www.linode.com/docs/development/version-control/how-to-install-git-on-linux-mac-and-windows/) to get help with installing Git.

## Hosting Website with GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. You can host your site on GitHub's github.io domain or your own custom domain.

Follow this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) on how to host your site with GitHub Pages.


## Hosting Website on BigHome

Computer Centre, IITB offers server space for the students and faculty which can be used for hosting your webpages on homepages.iitb.ac.in OR home.iitb.ac.in by logging in with LDAP.
