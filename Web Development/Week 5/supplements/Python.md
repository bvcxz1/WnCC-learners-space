# Web Dev (LS 2020) Supplementary Material: Python Basics

As Python is required to effectively learn Django, this article sheds some light on the basics of Python. What will be covered in this article is the absolute basic version of Python, just enough to help you understand what is actually happening in your Django code.

## Getting Started

### Installing Python

Here is a link to link to the [official downloads page](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)

We recommend to install Python 3.x (newer version) as it is fully compatible with Django and also supports some backward compatibilty with Python 2.x

### Basic Learning

Here is the link for the Python resourses from our __Code in Quarrantine__ initiative.
 - [Week 1 : Python](https://github.com/wncc/CodeInQuarantine/blob/master/Week_1_Python/README.md)

The basic level should be sufficient to get a basic understanding for the Web Development course, although you can explore the intermediate and advanced tutorials in your own time.
