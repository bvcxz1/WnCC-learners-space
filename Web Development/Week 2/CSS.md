# Web Dev (LS 2020) Week 2: CSS

Welcome back to Week 2 of our course on Web Development.
This week we will proceed further on our journey to becoming Web Developers, with focus on learning the core aspects and features of CSS. Our aim will be to help you master adding layout and a bit of style to your webpage, utilizing the power of CSS.

We expect you to have gone through the articles for [Git](https://github.com/wncc/learners-space/blob/master/Web%20Development/Week%201/Git.md) and [HTML](https://github.com/wncc/learners-space/blob/master/Web%20Development/Week%201/HTML.md), as we will be building up on it, adding to your Web Development skills.

So let's get on with it!


## Getting Started

Cascading Style Sheet(CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing how the content, written in some markup language should be displayed on screen. It controls the style and layout of web pages. So one can use CSS to alter the text styles, table sizes, and other aspects of webpages that previously could only be defined in a page's HTML. A working knowledge of HTML combined with a mastery over CSS will help you to design a fine look and feel to a webpage.

No further setup or installation is required for adding CSS attributes to an HTML page. As you already have a working webpage, you will only need the text/code editor you have set up last week.

Check out this [article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS) for understanding what CSS is, its basic structure and how it ties in with HTML.

## Video links
Learning by watching is very useful, specially in CSS because you can see live what a little change in properties can enhance the looking of our web. We have some good video links for you. For long videos, there is always a timestamp in the discription of video, so we suggest you prefer using that and watch specific topic you want to see. Simmilarly for video-playlists watch video specific to topic you want to understand.

## Flex Box and Grid

#### Some History
Everything you browse on the internet is contained in web pages. Those web pages accommodate content and that content needs a layout to fit itself in it. Nowadays, the technology has enabled us to browse the web on any screen dimension we wish for and your content should be responsive to any dimension we put forward. That’s where responsive layout design knocks the door.

CSS has always been used to design the layout and looking of web pages but producing complicated multi-column layouts has always been fiddly and hackish, and frustrating to get working consistently and precisely across browsers as well. First, we used tables, floats, positioning and inline-block, but all of these techniques left out a lot of major functionality (vertical centering, for example).

To solve these layout complications, CSS3 invented proper responsive layout models available natively in the browser, out of which - Flexbox, CSS Grid and Bootstrap became most popular and are widely supported across all platforms & browsers. These not only equipped us to create layouts that previously wasn’t feasible to create without involving JavaScript, but these also make code easier to understand and maintain.

#### More about them
These articles study [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) and [grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) in detail and mentions almost all the properties and things that you can do with flexbox and grid.
These videos can also be helpful.

 - [Grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFafSYg-PkI)
 
#### Flexbox vs Grid, what to use?
For basic designing, both flexbox and grid have great powers and you may use anything you find easy to use and according to your requirement.

## Assignment 2

Now it's time to apply what you have learned. You have to revamp your webpage from week 1, utilizing the CSS attributes we have discussed in the above sections!

You are free to use any other properties as well(apart from __atleast 6__).
 - Lastly, just as you did last week, host the webpage you created on GitHub/BigHome.
 - It is always recommended to keep your stylesheet saperate from HTML document i.e. prefer not doing inline css.
